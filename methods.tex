\section{Dataset}
\label{sec:dataset}

\subsection{Creation}
\label{sec:creation}

We created our used dataset from approximately 3000 scientific articles in pdf format. An important point was that these articles contained various information, and thereby we ensured that they come from different scientific fields. To be able to use the data we had to separate them from the pdfs and add additional information first.

We used a text mining pre-processing technique as introduced by Vijayarani et al.~\cite{Vijayarani2015} to separate the data from the pdf. This technique consists of three key steps, which are called the extraction-, the stopwords removal-, and the stemming-step. At first we seperated the article structure, and the raw text from the pdf. For those we used a framework descriped in \Cref{sec:extract_document_structure}. The stopwords removal-, and the stemming step was done as descriped in \cref{sec:stop_words} and \Cref{sec:stemming} (TODO: more detailed).

TODO: Write about the imrad type of an chapter

At last we performed a semi-automated annotation to link the references of the scientific articles. Thereby similarities about the references of an article and the titles of all other articles are compared as described in \Cref{sec:text_similarities}, and if they exceed a given threshold a recommentation to create a link between those two was given.

Each data record was created in such a way that it can be transferred directly to the database schema showen in \Cref{fig:database_schema}.

\subsection{Structure of a Scientific Article}
\label{sec:structure_scientific_article}

Write about the generall structure

\myfig{scientific_articles_tree}
      {width=0.90\textwidth}
      {Scientific Writing represended as a Tree}
      {Scientific Writing represended as a Tree}
      {fig:scientific_articles_tree}

\Cref{fig:scientific_articles_tree} showes the scientific article with regard to the individual sections. It is easy to see that the article itself is the root node, chapters are non-leaf nodes, and text areas are the leaf nodes.
