Today the internet is growing fast as users generate an increasing amount of data. Therefore, finding relevant information is getting more and more time-consuming. This happens as the internet consists of a larger amount of data that is distributed over various information sources. Search engines filter data, and reduce the time required to find relevant information. We focus on scientific literature search where search engines help to find scientific articles. An advantage of scientific articles is that they share a common structure to increase their readability. This structure is known is IMRaD (Introduction, Method, Results and Discussion). We tackle the question whether it is possible to improve the search result quality while searching for scientific works by leveraging IMRaD structure information. We use several state-of-the-art ranking algorithms, and compare them against each other in our experiments. Our results show that the importance of IMRaD chapter features depends on the complexity of the query. Finally, we focus on structured text retrieval and the influence of single chapters on the search result. We set out to tackle the problem to improve the quality of the results produced by state-of-the-art ranking algorithms for scientific literature research.
