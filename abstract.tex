Today the internet is growing fast as users generate a lot of data. Therefore, finding relevant information is getting more and more time-consuming. This happens as the time required to find a piece of information, and the number of information sources that need to be searched increases. Search engines filter data, and reduce the time required to find relevant information. We focus on the field of science where they help to simplify literature search. An advantage of scientific articles is that they have a common structure to increase the readability. This structure is known is IMRaD (Introduction, Method, Results and Discussion). We tackle the question whether it is possible to improve the search result quality while searching for scientific works by using IMRaD structure information. We used several state-of-the-art ranking algorithms, and compare them against each other in our experiments. Our results show that the importance of IMRaD chapter features depends on the complexity of the query. Finally, we focus on structured text retrieval and the influence of single chapters on the search result.
