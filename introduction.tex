Today a world without internet is unimaginable to many people. It affects almost all areas of our daily life. \Cref{fig:60minutes} showes the user activity of the internet within a single minute in $2018$. In this minute, for example, $3.7$ million search queries were made on Google, $18$ million messages were sent on Whatsapp, or $4.3$ million videos were viewed on YouTube. This suggests that the internet is big, fast-, and constantly changing.

Through this amount of data almost everything can be found on the internet, but not every piece of information has the same relevance for the user. This descripes the usage of information retrieval where information resources are obtained by the usage of a given piece of information. Applications which use information retrieval to provide these informations to the user are better known as search engines.

During a single search step the engines use different information channels. The first one is the information what the user expilicitly searchs for. This can be querie words, an image, a document, or any other kind of information the user provides to the engine. Using only this information is called explicit search. But there is also other information available, which was not explicitly provited by the user. This can be for example the location of the user, the date of the image, or structural information about a document. Using this kind of information additional to the explicit information is called implicit search.

Search engines have many different areas in which they are used. One of them is in the field of science, where they are used to simplify the literature research.

Main Question: Is it possible to improve the search result quality while searching for scientific publications through the use of IMRaD structure information?

Subquestion: Does the search result improve for explicit search using queries?

Subquestion: Does the search result improve for implicit search using complete scientific publications?

Subquestion: Does the search result improve if only a single chapter of scientific publications is used for searching?

Subsubquestion: Which chapter has the most influence?

Last - no result until now: How is it possible to find papers releated to a set of publications using clustered information about their similarities in various sections?
